## 🧪 What I Tested

| Test Type        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unit Test**     | Tested the `saveNote()` function for correct behavior and input validation. |
| **Integration Test** | Verified that saving a note updates the UI as expected.                     |
| **System Test**   | Simulated full note lifecycle: create → edit → delete.                      |

## 🐛 Bugs / Issues Identified

| Type             | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unit             | [e.g., Notes save even when title or content is empty]                      |
| Integration      | [e.g., Note text does not appear after clicking "Save Note"]                |
| System           | [e.g., Edit function deletes note without repopulating input fields]        |
| UI / UX          | [e.g., No feedback or confirmation after saving or deleting a note]         |
| Accessibility    | [e.g., Inputs have no labels for screen readers]                            |

## 💬 Reflection

### 1. What did you learn from testing this app?
> [e.g., I learned how to break down features into smaller testable parts.]

### 2. Which part of the app had the most bugs or problems?
> [e.g., The edit function was inconsistent and removed the note without updating the form.]

### 3. What testing strategy worked best for you?
> [e.g., Starting with exploratory clicks helped me find visible bugs before writing code-level tests.]

### 4. What was challenging during this lab?
> [e.g., Setting up Jest for DOM-based tests was tricky at first.]
